# repo: model repository with license templates, contribution policies, and other skeletal defaults

This repository serves as a "base" or starting point for repositories,
providing essentials such as licenses, contribution and branching policies,
gitignore patterns, makefiles and build scripts for various languages,
and other "skeletal" features too often written or researched from scratch
when setting up a new project.
